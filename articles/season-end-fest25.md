Season 1 is almost officially over — and wow, what a journey it’s been. From the very first day we logged in, unsure of what to expect, to the final boss fights and base tours, this world has grown into something truly special.

We’ve had our share of laughs, fails, wild builds, and unforgettable moments. Remember that time when we got absolutely humbled by the vindicators in the illager manor? Or when we all teamed up to take down the dragon and half of us forgot beds? Yeah… good times.

To celebrate everything, we’re hosting the Season End Fest - from March 27- 28, we are having a mini event to look back at our favorite moments, showcase our proudest builds, and just chill before the new season kicks off. Expect some throwback screenshots, mini games, and maybe a surprise or two.

So before we jump into the new world and start from scratch, let’s take a night or two to appreciate the chaos, the memories, and the friendships we’ve made along the way.

Thanks for making Season 1 awesome. Let’s make Season 2 even better!
