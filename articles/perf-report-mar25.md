Rise and shine, CS1A folks, update 2.25.9 just dropped!<br><br>
Some small by fun tweaks and surprises this time—think QoL changes, a new friend in chat, and something that goes boom a little differently now. <br><br>
Big reset’s getting closer too… you ready?<br><br>

**Server wide**<br><br>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-white ml-10 space-y-2 mb-5">
    <li>Saplings on the ground will automatically plant themselves if they land on a suitable dirt block. This also works for seeds dropped on tilled farmland.</li>
    <li>Creepers that are set on fire will now begin their ignition countdown. However, this only applies to fire from sources like flint and steel or burning arrows — lava-induced fire damage is excluded.</li>
    <li>Introduced the CS1A Bot, a server-side assistant that reacts to specific phrases or keywords in chat. It’s designed to be fun and interactive, and may respond with helpful tips, reminders, or jokes based on what players say.</li>
    <li>You can now mention in chat using @ + the username. This will play a "ding" sound for the mentioned player.</li>
    <li>Improved anti-grief protections in towns and marked zones.</li>
    <li>Updated /motd and welcome message.</li>
</ul>
