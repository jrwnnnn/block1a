                Greetings, players!<br><br>
                Over the past month, we've made some significant strides in improving server performance, and I’m here to give you a quick update on how things are running. From smoother gameplay to reduced lag spikes, we’ve been hard at work ensuring that your time on the server remains as enjoyable as possible.<br><br>
                Here’s a breakdown of what we’ve achieved. (Warning: It's super technical).<br><br>

                    <p class="text-white font-bold">TPS (Ticks Per Second)</p>
                    <p>
                        Minecraft server ideally runs at 20 TPS, meaning everything is happening in real time with no delay. When TPS drops, actions like mining, mob movement, redstone circuits, and chunk loading become noticeably laggy. Last month, we saw frequent dips to around 15-16 TPS, and in the worst cases, it went down to 8.5 TPS. After several rounds of profiling and adjustments, our average TPS for March increased to a near-perfect 19.8, with lows rarely falling under 17. This drastic improvement means a lot less rubber-banding, smoother interactions with mobs and items, and more reliable redstone behavior. The percentage of uptime spent below 18 TPS has dropped from 38% in March to under 5% in March—an impressive leap.

                    <p>
                        These changes led to a 35–50% drop in average tick durations in affected regions, significantly raising server-wide TPS and ensuring consistent real-time performance.

                    <p>
                        We noticed in February that tick durations were regularly exceeding 90ms, and in extreme cases going over 150ms—this translated to severe lag spikes that interrupted gameplay. In March, with optimized entity handling and plugin load reductions, we brought the average tick duration down to 55ms, and peaks rarely exceeded 90ms. Spark’s flamegraph visualization helped us pinpoint which events (like mob explosions or chunk generation) were spiking tick times, allowing us to apply targeted fixes. As a result, gameplay is now more consistent, even when multiple players are online.

                    <p>
                        In February, we observed frequent GC pauses, some lasting over 150ms, which interrupted gameplay unexpectedly. To solve this, we adjusted our JVM flags and increased allocated memory from 6GB to 8GB. We also tuned how and when GC cycles are triggered. With these changes, average GC pause times dropped from 60ms to just 20ms, and peak pauses rarely cross 50ms anymore. This means no more random “hiccups” while exploring or fighting mobs, and overall memory management has become far more efficient.

                    <p>
                        Last month, our average entity count per active chunk was over 500, and some mob farms had peaks of 650+ entities in one space. We identified chunk-heavy zones and applied optimizations like tweaking the mob cap, enforcing stricter despawn rules, and reducing chunk load radius during idle times.
